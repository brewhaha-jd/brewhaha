# Zenhub Organization
Let’s keep the new issues column empty if possible.

Icebox can be issues that we need to implement whenever we have free time, later sprints

Backlog are for issues that need to be done in this sprint but we havent started yet.

In Progress is what’s in progress right now. Like you’re coding it.

Review is for when you have something finished but needs to be merged in/reviewed by someone on the team.

Done is when you have merged it.

We’ll move things to closed at the end of each sprint to help us keep track of what we’ve done in the sprint.

Please add story points whenever you create a new ticket/issue.

Story points are measured typically in hours. Realistically I think we’ll only allocate a few hours a week to the class. So each person should be able to handle maybe 10 points a sprint. So think about how much work each ticket requires and point it accordingly. Adding a simple UI button is 1 point. Adding a new view or data model might be a few.


# Github Organization
